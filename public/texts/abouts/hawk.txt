Clinton Francis Barton is a fictional character portrayed by Jeremy Renner in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise—based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name—more commonly known by his alias, Hawkeye. Barton is depicted as an expert marksman, archer and hand-to-hand combatant, with his preferred weapon being a recurve bow. Barton, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., is sent to kill Natasha Romanoff but decides to recruit and befriend her instead. Barton becomes a founding member of the Avengers after being recruited by Steve Rogers, participating in the Battle of New York, the HYDRA uprising, and the conflict against Ultron. Barton sides with Rogers during the Avengers internal conflict over the Sokovia Accords; he is placed on house arrest as a result. After Barton's family is decimated during the Blip, he becomes a vigilante and violently dismantles organized crime across the world as Ronin. He rejoins the Avengers during their mission to undo Thanos' actions using time travel; Barton attains the Soul Stone after Romanoff sacrifices herself to obtain it. Barton and his allies successfully restore the trillions of lives lost to Thanos, and he participates in the final and subsequently victorious battle against him. After reuniting with his restored family, his time as Ronin causes continued conflicts with various elements of organized crime and he takes in a protégé named Kate Bishop.
