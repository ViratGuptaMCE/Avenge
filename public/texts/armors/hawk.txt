Barton, working as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, is sent to kill Natasha Romanoff, but instead recruits her, with the pair becoming close friends and they serve on various missions together, including one in Budapest in which Romanoff attempts to kill General Dreykov.[a] At some point, Barton marries Laura Barton. Nick Fury then assists him in setting up a safehouse for his family on a farm in rural Iowa.[b] In 2010, Barton is sent on a mission in New Mexico, where he arms himself with a compound bow, preparing to kill Thor to keep him from retrieving Mjolnir, but chooses not to after watching Thor fail to lift the hammer.The character has been the subject of various jokes including internet memes[47] and a 2012 Saturday Night Live skit (in which Renner portrayed the character),[48] highlighting the perceived absurdity of a regular human archer being amongst aliens, super soldiers, and gods. He was also perceived as being regularly "sidelined" during his appearances.[49] During Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Barton himself acknowledged this when he stated, "The city is flying and we're fighting an army of robots.

And having zero superpowers â€” I love that this guy has will and mental fortitude that anyone can have".[51] Barton has been described as going from "the butt of all jokes" to a fan favorite and underdog
