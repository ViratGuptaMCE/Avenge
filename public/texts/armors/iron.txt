In most depictions, Iron Man does not have any superhuman abilities. He instead derives his strength from powered armor of his own design.[155] When first designing the character, Lee was more interested in the armor's invocation of Arthurian knights, and he introduced advanced technology to modernize this vision.
The armor was gray in its first appearance, but Iron Man gave it gold plating in the subsequent issue, and a few issues thereafter it was replaced by the red and gold look that the character became identified with.[165] The character constantly seeks to develop newer, more advanced variations on the armor, and he frequently designs specialized models for specific purposes.[166] These include the space armor, the stealth armor, and the deep sea armor,[167] as well as the Hulkbuster armor to engage in combat with the Hulk.[166] Developments in the armor's design often reflect real world advances in technology as well as trends in science fiction.[168] The use of a technological suit of armor has allowed artists to frequently make changes to the character's appearance without controversy.
